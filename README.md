Fury-of-the-Elements
====================

A minecraft mod that I am making that brings the elements of the world, fire, water, air, and, earth, to the game. The mod will also add two extra elements: Aether and Void.

This mod will potentionally add: biomes(ex: cloud biome), mobs(ex: fire elemental), legendary items(ex: Excalibur), dimensions(ex: The Void), bosses(ex: Mortus the God of Death), and much more!

*Ps: Mortus is not a real god for those who are wondering...
